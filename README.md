# Computational_Physics_python_code
Implementation of various numerical methods to solve physical problems using Python, Numpy, matplotlib .
This Repo includes python code for some mathematical and physical problem solving algorithms and methods.

Which includes solving linear equations by Matrix manipulation methods as Gauss elemination, Jacobi method, Cholesky,LU decomposition,Inverse power method,Gauss jordan method, Gauss seidel Method, Jacobi diagonalisation
and solving differential equation by euler and huen's mrtod, midpoint method, runge kutta method(RK-2 and RK-4 method), shooting method, finite difference method, trapezoidal and simpson's 1/3rd nad 3/8 methods and 
simulation method montecarlo method.
